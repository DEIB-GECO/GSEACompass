# GSEAWrap
A minimalistic yet powerful app to run *GSEA*, pre-ranked *GSEA* and *ssGSEA* and, **mostly**, do some good-old post-analysis elaboration on the results!

# Frameworks
All these good things powered by:
- *GSEApy* on the python backend to run genomic analysises
- *Electron.js* on the desktop frontend
- *Datatables.js* as a view engine for post-analysis tables
