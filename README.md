## Frameworks

This tool is powered by:

- *GSEApy* on the python backend to run genomic analyses and graphical elaborations
- *Electron.js* on the desktop frontend
- *Datatables.js* as a view engine for post-analysis tables

## Build instructions

### Binaries

Download GSEACompass source code

### Build from source

Make sure, before running GSEAWrap in a development enviroment, to fulfill these dependencies.

#### Rust

The Rust development environment has to be installed on your machine, since it's compulsory to install and run GSEApy.
Follow this [link](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for the official instructions to download and install it.

#### Python

Python3.12 and pip must be installed too, follow the official guides to install them ([Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)).

#### System

```
#### Fedora/RHEL
Run the following command if your OS is Fedora or similar:
```bash
sudo dnf install libquadmath libquadmath-devel
```

#### N.B. for Windows users: 
Make sure Python and Rust are in the PATH environmental variable.

#### Python libraries

Once Python and pip are installed, open the directory in which you have unzipped the GSEACompass archive and run the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all python-based dependencies needed to run the app.

### Build dependencies

#### Node.js

Mind that Node.js is required to be installed on you system in order to build and run this application.
Moreover, as suggested on the official Electron.js website:
> Please install Node.js using pre-built installers for your platform. You may encounter incompatibility issues with different development tools otherwise.
>
Follow the [official guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to install it.

#### Npm dependencies

Once installed Node.js, all npm-based dependencies can be installed with the following command, make sure to be in your local repository directory:

```bash
npm install
```

### Build and run
